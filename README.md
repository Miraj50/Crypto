My program uses GMP library for handling arbitrary precision arithmetic. To use it you will have to install the library which is to be done as follows.

1) Extract the files from the above gmp-6.1.1.tar.xz to gmp-6.1.1

2) Open terminal, go to the gmp-6.1.1 folder and run -
a) ./configure b) make c) sudo make install

3) Copy the "project.cpp" file inside the gmp-6.1.1 folder

4) To compile and run write the commands - a) g++ project.cpp -lgmp b) ./a.out

A menu will be displayed regarding what all you can do with the program. Choose your options as per your choice and run your test cases.
